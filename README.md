# Trivia refactor

Just try to refactor the [Trivia Game](https://github.com/jbrains/trivia)

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pitchart/php-trivia-kata.git
composer install
```

## Objectives
You can practice different things using this code base. For example…

### Golden Master
We can’t write reasonable unit tests without refactorings first. But we don’t want to refactor without tests at all.

But we can test the application as a whole. Gain control over all external input sources (RNGs, system time, keyboard input and so on). Then save all outputs produced (console output, emails sent, files changed etc). This is our Golden Master.

Now we can change the code and compare if it still yields the same results as before.

### Free Fall

This is another thing to try out. And probably it’s a good idea to not learn this in production. Just use your IDE refactorings. Do not waste time to understand the code. Trust your IDE and use features like extract method or invert if statement. You will be surprised about the results.
